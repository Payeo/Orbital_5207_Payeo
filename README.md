# Orbital_5207_Payeo

## Level
Apollo 11

## Motivation 
Many of us often find ourselves meeting up with friends to catch up over a meal. Everyone wants to meet, but handling the payment is always a hassle. We would find it unfair if the bill was split evenly, especially when there was a person who splurged and got the most expensive item on the menu.

It is hard to account for the exact amount one has to pay the other party, especially when different people pay for different items. The matter is made worse when there are multiple receipts. More often than not, this either leads to an unnecessarily long time calculating the exact amount or leads to multiple transfers back and fro between parties.

Furthermore, we have to trust that our friends would remember to make payments as well. Is there a better way to streamline this calculation process and make it more convenient for everyone to settle their bills?
